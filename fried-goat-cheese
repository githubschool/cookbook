#FRIED GOAT CHEESE & HEIRLOOM TOMATO TOASTS

##INGREDIENTS
4 thick slices multi-grain bread, toasted
1 avocado
2 heirloom tomatoes
4 oz. goat cheese
¼ c. flour
pinch of salt and pepper
1 egg
½ c. panko bread crumbs
¼ c. olive oil
¼ c. balsamic reduction

##INSTRUCTIONS
Slice your 4oz. log of goat cheese into four even thin pieces. Place them on a piece of cling wrap and seal. Freeze them for at least 2 hours or until solid.
In a shallow bowl combine the flour, salt and pepper. In a second bowl whisk the egg and in a third seperate bowl add your panko bread crumbs.
Remove the goat cheese pieces from the freezer and one at a time dip them in the flour, then egg and lastly panko bread crumbs, being sure to coat all sides evenly.
In a small skillet over high heat, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and swirl around to coat the pan. Add two of the breaded goat cheese pieces to the hot oil. Turn the pieces after 40-60 seconds on each side, or golden brown. Be sure and fry each side, including the edges, well so the goat cheese doesn't run out. Place the fried goat cheese on a paper towel.
Repeat the process by adding the remaining olive oil and goat cheese pieces to the pan.
Meanwhile, top each toasted piece of bread with slices of avocado, tomato, fried goat cheese and a tablespoon of balsamic reduction. Serve immediately.

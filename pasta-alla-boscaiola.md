# Pasta alla Boscaiola

## Ingredients

- 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms*
- 2 cups hot water
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound fresh crimini mushrooms, chopped
- 1/2 pound fresh portobello mushrooms, stemmed, dark gills scraped off, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/3 cup dry Marsala
- 1 pound fusilli pasta
- 1 cup vegetable stock
- 1/4 cup whipping cream
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about 3 ounces)
- 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter
- Additional grated Parmesan cheese

## Preparations

Place porcini mushrooms in small bowl. Pour 2 cups hot water over. Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 25 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to work surface and coarsely chop. Discard soaking liquid.

Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add porcini, crimini and portobello mushrooms, minced garlic and bay leaf. Saut√© until mushrooms are brown and tender, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add Marsala and simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, scraping up browned bits, about 1 minute. Season mushroom mixture to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. (Mushroom mixture can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well.

Mix vegetable stock and whipping cream into mushroom mixture and simmer 3 minutes. Add 1 cup Parmesan cheese, butter and drained pasta; toss to coat. Cook until sauce coats pasta, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve, passing additional grated Parmesan separately.
